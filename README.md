# ** World of Wonder **
<p>World of Wonder is an interactive, online application dedicated to bringing a musuem to you. There are varieties of collections to view and artifacts to learn about! With text to speech features, and an ability to take notes on artifacts as you wander throughout the rooms, curate their own exhibit by saving artifacts, and the application is user friendly for all ages! Have fun exploring this world of wonder....</p>

## Approach Taken
<p> This is a full stack web application created using MERN-auth, MongoDB, Mongoose, REACT, NodeJS and CSS. Users can enter a world of wonder as they wander through museum exhibits and click on artifacts to learn more. The application utilizes the Auckland Museum API, as well as the SpeechSynthesis API for text to speech functionality. World of Wonder incorporates full RESTful routing, MERN authentication and REACT Bootstrap modals throughout. </p>
